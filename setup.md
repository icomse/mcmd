title: Setup
---

There are three possible ways to engage with these tutorial materials:

1. Install the required dependencies locally (Caveats: This can be frustrating if you are still learning system administration and software dependency skills, and for larger simulations you will be limited by your local machine's hardware)
1. Use a container on your local machine (Caveat: This is a large download, requires setting up a virtual machine, and you will be limited by your local machine's hardware)
1. Use a container on a compute cluster (Caveat: This may requires your cluster's sysadmins to set up the container)

## Data Sets


Let's add the random.gsd file to the repository so it needn't be generated for the first exercise.
Add a link to data directory.
