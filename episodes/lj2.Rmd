## Plans



OK, now that we've run our first simulations, let's add in a bit more complexity.

Last time we did this:

    1. Turn on hoomd-blue, a simulation engine that works nicely in python
    1. Load in a configuration of randomly-packed spheres that has been created for us
    1. Define Lennard-Jones interaction rules and an NVT ensemble
    1. Step forward 10000 steps.
    1. Visualize the last snapshot.

This time we're going to :

    1. Turn on hoomd-blue, a simulation engine that works nicely in python
    1. Load in a configuration of randomly-packed spheres that has been created for us
    1. Define Lennard-Jones interaction rules and an NVT ensemble
    1. NEW: Set up a logger that will save simulation information we can use.
    1. Step forward 10000 steps.
    1. NEW: Plot kinetic temperature

We'll start with the same process we did last time, loading up a system and setting up the simulation.

```python
import hoomd
import gsd.hoomd

#This is steps 1-3 from before
# Attach to CPU and create simulation
cpu = hoomd.device.CPU()
sim = hoomd.Simulation(device=cpu,seed=0)
sim.create_state_from_gsd(filename='random.gsd') #N and V are set here

#Potential and integrator setup
integrator = hoomd.md.Integrator(dt=0.005)
cell = hoomd.md.nlist.Cell(buffer = 0.4)
lj_potential = hoomd.md.pair.LJ(nlist=cell)
lj_potential.params[('A','A')] = dict(epsilon=1,sigma=1)
lj_potential.r_cut[('A','A')]=2.5
nvt = hoomd.md.methods.NVT(kT=1.5,filter=hoomd.filter.All(),tau=1.)
integrator.forces.append(lj_potential)
integrator.methods.append(nvt)
sim.operations.integrator = integrator

# Set the simulation state 
sim.state.thermalize_particle_momenta(filter=hoomd.filter.All(), kT=1.5)
```

Now that our system is ready to roll, let's tell HOOMD about the quantities we want it to keep track of for us.
HOOMD-blue has a convenient built-in function for common thermodynamic values, and we'll also keep track of how
long the simulation has been running, in terms of time steps and also "wall time", i.e. real-life seconds it
takes the computer to run our simulation.

```python
#NEW logger
# We need to define which atoms participate in logging, what's logged, and where to store that info.
selection = hoomd.filter.All() # "which atoms"
logger = hoomd.logging.Logger() # will be used for "what's logged"
trajfile = 'traj2.gsd'
writer = hoomd.write.GSD(filename=trajfile, # "where to store"
                             trigger=hoomd.trigger.Periodic(100), #when to store
                             mode='wb',
                             filter=selection) #filter=hoomd.filter.Null() to only store log

thermo_props = hoomd.md.compute.ThermodynamicQuantities(filter=selection) # What to store
logger.add(thermo_props)
logger.add(sim,quantities=['timestep','walltime','tps'])
writer.log = logger #need to tell our write which logger to use when it's logging info

sim.operations.computes.append(thermo_props) #tell our simulation to *compute* the thermo properties
sim.operations.writers.append(writer) # tell our simulation which writer(s) to use
```

Great! Now we're all set to run and get at the logged quantities. Let's take a look at what we've got
to work with first:

```python


# Run  the simulation  (a few seconds)
sim.run(1e4)

# Use the log to analyze properties
traj = gsd.hoomd.open(trajfile,'rb')
traj[0].log #let's see what things we can access in the log
```

You should get output looking something like this:

```

 'md/compute/ThermodynamicQuantities/pressure': array([0.40569009]),

 'Simulation/tps': array([348.21513364])}
```

Alright, one good sanity test for simulations is to see if our thermostat is behaving reasonably, that
is, if our temperature oscillates about the chosen average value. Let's plot out our temperature!

```python
from day1_utils import arrays_from_gsd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = 'timestep'
y = 'kinetic_temperature'
[xd,yd] = arrays_from_gsd(trajfile,keys=[x,y])
plt.plot(xd,yd)
plt.xlabel(x)
plt.ylabel(y)
plt.show()
```

- Compare kinetic temperature with setpoint temperature

- Vary T, P to change density
- Discussion of units
- Discussion of various file formats

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- HOOMD simulation objects have "computes" and "writers"
- We pass the same thermodynamic quantities to each that we want computed and written.
