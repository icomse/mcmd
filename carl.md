Carl is a materials science postdoc working at a national lab. His PhD in chemistry focused on the synthesis of aromatic macromolucles with unique optical properties. Now as a postdoc, he plans to learn enough modeling to help him guide his experiments while applin for his next job. He can't decide whether to follow his dream of becoming a professor or to get a job doing data science at a pharmaceutical company.
